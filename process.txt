One night, Twinkle saw a sad moon. The moon looked lonely and grey. Twinkle wanted to help her new friend feel happy again.

She decided to share her brightest light with the moon. Twinkle shone and twinkled so brightly that the moon smiled and became shiny and silver.

All the stars and the moon danced together in the sky. Twinkle learned that even the smallest star can make a big difference with kindness and friendship.
